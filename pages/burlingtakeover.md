## The Burling Library Take Over
Despite CBSâ€™s efforts, there were many aspects of campus life that negatively affected Black students and that the administration was not actively addressing. In order to put pressure on the college to address their issues, the members of CBS staged a take over of Burling Library. 
At the time, the office of the president resided in Burling, and it was a main hub of campus activity. For this reason, CBS students chose the library as their protest location.
On the morning of November 29th, 1971, over 50 students occupied Burling Library. The students chained the doors, prevented white patrons from entering, and distributed The Black Manifesto; a list of 10 demands designed to improve campus life for Black students and faculty.

## Demands for a Black Library
One of the 10 demands included in the Black Manifesto was the creation of a Black Library in Burling. In addition to books, the CBS activists wanted the Black Library to include audiovisual equipment specifically for the use of Black students. 

This was not the first time CBS advocated for a Black Library. In 1968, CBS proposed that $400 of the SGA money go to creating a Black Library.

## College Response
The administration and faculty at Grinnell College quickly met to discuss the demands. The minutes from these discussions are featured below. Overall, there was little opposition voiced against the demands, but many had questions about how these demands would be met logistically and fairly.

## Inital Library Response
At first, the library made a paltry attempt at meeting the demand for a Black Library. Three shelves near the front of the library was populated with 50-odd Black Studies books. This was far from the Black Library CBS had envisioned.
